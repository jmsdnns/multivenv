# MultiVenv

I wanted something lighter than virtualenv wrapper that does basically the same thing. That's it.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| mkvenv | make a new venv |
| usevenv | enable a venv |
| stopvenv | alias for deactivate |
| rmvenv | delete a venv |
| lsvenvs | list your venvs |
| cdvenv | go to the directory root of a venv |

Also, tab completion works for:
* usevenv
* rmvenv
* cdvenv
